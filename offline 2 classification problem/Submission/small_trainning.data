ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT

HONG KONG, April 8 -

Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears
among many of Asia's exporting nations that the row could inflict
far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said.  They
told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan
might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on
American imports of their products.  But some exporters said that
while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term
Tokyo's loss might be their gain.  The U.S. Has said it will impose
300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on
April 17, in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a
pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10
billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would
virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes.  "We wouldn't
be able to do business," said a spokesman for leading Japanese
electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T&gt;.  "If
the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months
it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to
tariffs) to the U.S.," said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo
office of broker &lt;James Capel and Co&gt;.  In Taiwan, businessmen and
officials are also worried.  "We are aware of the seriousness of the
U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us," said
a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.  Taiwan
had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it
with the U.S.  The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange
reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.  "We must
quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs
to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from
possible U.S. Retaliation," said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile
exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group&gt;.  A senior official of South Korea's
trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the
U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief
exports are similar to those of Japan.  Last year South Korea had a
trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion
dlrs in 1985.  In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough
curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors
in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S.  In Hong Kong,
where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost
semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But
other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be
outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports.  "That is a very
short-term view," said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the
Federation of Hong Kong Industry.  "If the whole purpose is to prevent
imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more
serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining
trade," he said.  The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export
market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks
between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry
Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.  "This kind of
deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major
trading partners of ours is a very serious matter," Button said.  He
said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia's two
largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that
country.  Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the
trade stand-off continue.  Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the
Japanese economy.  The measures proposed include a large supplementary
budget and record public works spending in the first half of the
financial year.  They also call for stepped-up spending as an
emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.  Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda, Japan's deputy
minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), are due to meet
in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute.  REUTER

CHINA DAILY SAYS VERMIN EAT 7-12 PCT GRAIN STOCKS

PEKING, April 8 -

A survey of 19 provinces and seven cities showed vermin consume
between seven and 12 pct of China's grain stocks, the China Daily
said.  It also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes, or 25 pct, of
China's fruit output are left to rot, and 2.1 mln tonnes, or up to 30
pct, of its vegetables. The paper blamed the waste on inadequate
storage and bad preservation methods.  It said the government had
launched a national programme to reduce waste, calling for improved
technology in storage and preservation, and greater production of
additives. The paper gave no further details.  REUTER

AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT

SYDNEY, April 8 -

Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW), Victoria and Western Australia
yesterday lifted their ban on foreign-flag ships carrying containers
but NSW ports are still being disrupted by a separate dispute,
shipping sources said.  The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim,
had prevented the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels,
they said.  The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration
Commission today.  Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling
in the ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.  The
industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week of action
called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to protest changes to the
state's workers' compensation laws.  The shipping sources said the
various port unions appear to be taking it in turn to work for a short
time at the start of each shift and then to walk off.  Cargo handling
in the ports has been disrupted, with container movements most
affected, but has not stopped altogether, they said.  They said they
could not say how long the disruption will go on and what effect it
will have on shipping movements.  REUTER

WESTERN MINING TO OPEN NEW GOLD MINE IN AUSTRALIA

MELBOURNE, April 8 -

Western Mining Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;WMNG.S&gt; (WMC) said it will establish
a new joint venture gold mine in the Northern Territory at a cost of
about 21 mln dlrs.  The mine, to be known as the Goodall project, will
be owned 60 pct by WMC and 40 pct by a local W.R. Grace and Co &lt;GRA&gt;
unit. It is located 30 kms east of the Adelaide River at Mt. Bundey,
WMC said in a statement It said the open-pit mine, with a conventional
leach treatment plant, is expected to produce about 50,000 ounces of
gold in its first year of production from mid-1988. Annual ore
capacity will be about 750,000 tonnes.  REUTER

SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER

TOKYO, April 8 -

Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T&gt; is certain to lose its status as Japan's
most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo
Bank, financial analysts said.  Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits
of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small,
struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable
loans, in October.  But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh
Komatsu told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its
position.  "We'll be back in position in first place within three
years," Komatsu said in an interview.  He said that while the merger
will initially reduce Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will
vastly expand Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area
where it has been relatively weak.  But financial analysts are divided
on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off.  Some said
Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller
bank's large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective
than creating a comparable branch network from scratch.  The analysts
agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the
lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition,
but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves.  "They've made
bold moves to put everything in place. Now it's largely out of their
hands," said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson.
Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter
U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank
Goldman, Sachs and Co.  Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln
dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time
being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to
exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was
stricter than Sumitomo expected," said one analyst.  But Komatsu said
the move will pay off in time.  "U.S. Regulations will change in the
near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait
two or three years, not until the 21st century," Komatsu said.
Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the
securities business at home.  Article 65 of the Securities and
Exchange Act, Japan's version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act,
separates commercial from investment banking.  But the walls between
the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation
will create new opportunities.  "We need to find new business
chances," Komatsu said. "In some cases these will be securities
related, in some cases trust bank related. That's the kind of
deregulation we want."  Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus
on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond
dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in
which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.  He said Sumitomo is
cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here
through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.  The
Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities
subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar
decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the
parent holds a less than 50 pct.  But Komatsu is reluctant to push
hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.  "We don't want
to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years,"
he said.  Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace
disappearing demand from big business, he added.  The analysts said
Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most
recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies," said Kleinwort's
Smithson.  "After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is
right or wrong."  REUTER

SUBROTO SAYS INDONESIA SUPPORTS TIN PACT EXTENSION

JAKARTA, April 8 -

Mines and Energy Minister Subroto confirmed Indonesian support for an
extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA), but said a
new pact was not necessary.  Asked by Reuters to clarify his statement
on Monday in which he said the pact should be allowed to lapse,
Subroto said Indonesia was ready to back extension of the ITA.  "We
can support extension of the sixth agreement," he said. "But a seventh
accord we believe to be unnecessary."  The sixth ITA will expire at
the end of June unless a two-thirds majority of members vote for an

CHINA INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES IN FIRST QUARTER

PEKING, April 8 -

China's industrial output rose 14.1 pct in the first quarter of 1987
against the same 1986 period, the People's Daily said.  Its overseas
edition said the growth rate, which compares with a target of seven
pct for the whole of 1987, was "rather high" but the base in the first
quarter of 1986 was on the low side. Industrial output grew 4.4 pct in
the first quarter of 1986.  It said China's industrial production this
year has been normal but product quality and efficiency need further
improvement. It gave no further details.  REUTER

GERMAN INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT SEEN STAGNATING

WEST BERLIN, April 8 -

The number of workers employed in the West German industrial sector
stagnated in the last quarter of 1986 as a 50,000 increase in overall
employment benefited only the services branch, the DIW economic
institute said.  A DIW report added the general downturn in the
economy since last Autumn had had a negative effect on the willingness
of firms to take on workers. It referred to a marked downturn in the
number of workers taken on in the capital goods sector.  New orders
for manufacturing industry goods have mostly fallen or stagnated in
recent months, but data for February finally showed a reversal of the
trend, with a 1.9 pct rise.  REUTER

BOWATER INDUSTRIES PROFIT EXCEED EXPECTATIONS

LONDON, April 8 -

Bowater Industries Plc &lt;BWTR.L&gt; 1986 pretax profits of 48.0 mln stg
exceeded market expectations of around 40 mln and pushed the company's
shares up sharply to a high of 491p from 468p last night, dealers
said.  The shares later eased back to 481p. Bowater reported a 32.4
mln stg profit in 1985.  The company said in a statement accompanying
the results that the underlying trend showed improvement and it
intended to expand further by developing existing businesses and
seeking new opportunities.  It added that it had appointed David Lyon,
currently managing director of Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L&gt; as its new chief
executive.  Analysts noted that Bowater's profits of 18.9 mln stg from
13.2 mln previously had been given a boost by pension benefits of 4.5
mln stg.  Profit from Australia and the Far East showed the greatest
percentage rise, jumping 55.0 pct to 15.5 mln from 10.0 mln, while the

CITIBANK NORWAY UNIT LOSES SIX MLN CROWNS IN 1986

OSLO, April 8 -

Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N&gt;, the Norwegian subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank,
said it made a net loss of just over six mln crowns in 1986 --
although foreign bankers said they expect it to show 1987 profits
after two lean years.  Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad
told Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries
operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for
investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump
in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.  Foreign banks
have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985.
Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's second-hand
securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and
lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year.
Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but Sejerstad said a
profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and
better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around
18 dlrs a barrel.  Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's &lt;CMB.N&gt;
subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy losses
and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.  REUTER

VIEILLE MONTAGNE SAYS 1986 CONDITIONS UNFAVOURABLE

BRUSSELS, April 8 -

A sharp fall in the dollar price of zinc and the depreciation of the
U.S. Currency created unfavourable economic conditions for Vieille

factors led to a squeeze on refining margins and an 18.24 pct fall in
sales and services income despite an unchanged level of activity.
Vieille Montagne, which is actively pursuing a restructuring program,

for the closure of an electrolysis plant, compared with a 250 mln
franc net profit in 1985.  REUTER
